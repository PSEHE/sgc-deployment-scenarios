# sgc-deployment-scenarios
Optimizing resilience hub deployment for overall population coverage, climate vulnerability, and more.

* Uses Networkx package to perform network analysis: https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2017/lessons/L7/network-analysis.html
* Resilience hub locations based on prior PSE analysis with geofabrik OSM data
* Coverage maximized for climate vulnerabilities using various public datasets on air, fire, EJ, etc.
* Users should save large datasets that must be stored locally one directory up from this repo and write code accordingly
